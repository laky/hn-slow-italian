Hacker News in Slow Italian - The most interesting tech content in a language accessible for learners

To run, install prerequisits and define on your command line:

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
    export PLAYHT_USER_ID="<PLAYHT_USER_ID>"
    export PLAYHT_API_KEY="<PLAYHT_API_KEY>"

Note, this requires accounts for Open AI and Play.HT. Running this will incur costs to your accounts. Generally, the OpenAI GPT4 cost is about $1 to summarise the 5 links and generate an episode. The transcript will come out to usually around 1,500-2,000 words that will be taken from your Play.HT quota.

This is a very quick and dirty implementation, errors when accessing the websites need to be handled better etc. Use at your own risk.
